It enables users to perform tasks such as scanning open ports on IP addresses, conducting Denial of Service (DoS) tests, and gathering detailed information about servers and IP configurations. The tool is typically used for educational, research, or authorized security auditing purposes to evaluate the resilience and exposure of networked systems.
